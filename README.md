`App` takes care of the essentials. initiating Firebase connection and checkes if a user is logged in as well as setting up the Redux Store. We also check if the user is logged in and we add our SCSS styles to the application.

React `Router` takes care of displaying each page. 

Each `page` component takes care of fetching and keeping the data relevant and updated for that page. This data will be saved in the page components state or in some cases Redux Store. This information will be passed down to the appropriate components that take care of the rendering to the screen.
